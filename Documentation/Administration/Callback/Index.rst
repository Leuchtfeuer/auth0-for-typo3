Callback
========

With version 3.2.0 of this extension, it is possible to use only one generic callback URL for Auth0 requests. Technically a
PSR-15 Middleware is used to take care of the Auth0 response and - for example - redirect a user after a successful log in. The
URL path of the callback is `/auth0/callback`. So, when your domain is `https://www.example.com`, you only need to configure the
URL `https://www.ecample.com/auth0/callback` as allowed callback URL (and allowed logout URL if you are using the single sign out
feature).

   You only need to define one URL as your callback in the application settings of your Auth0 application.

RSA Key Pair
============

By default, the generated token which includes all the relevant data is signed with TYPO3Â´s encryption key. To increase the
security of your application, it is recommended and possible to use your own RSA key pair for signing the token. The path to your
private and public key file can be configured within the :ref:`extension configuration <admin-configuration-privateKeyFile>`. To
create a new key pair, you must execute the following commands on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
   openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key
