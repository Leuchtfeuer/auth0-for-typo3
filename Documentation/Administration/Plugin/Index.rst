Plugin
======
This extensions comes with a log in / log off plugin for frontend users. It is located underneath the plugin tab when creating a
new content element.

Configuration
=============
In general there are two configurations you have to care about. First of all, you need to select one Auth0 application you want to
communicate with. Afterwards you can configure where the user should be redirected to. The configuration of that is similar to the
standard TYPO3 frontend login form plugin. Please take a look into the official TYPO3
`documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/felogin/LoginMechanism/RedirectModes/Index.html>`__ for more details.
