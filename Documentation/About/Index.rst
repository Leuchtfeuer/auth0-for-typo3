login links to any existing Auth0 application, no matter if your TYPO3 instance is connected to an Auth0 tenant or not.

About Auth0
===========

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with `multiple authentication sources <https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders>`__, either social like
  **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity
  systems like Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider.
* Add authentication through more traditional
  `username/password databases <https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db>`__.
* Add support for `linking different user accounts <https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts>`__ with the same user.
* Support for generating signed `JSON Web Tokens <https://auth0.com/docs/jwt>`__ to call your APIs and flow the user
  identity securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through
  `JavaScript rules <https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current>`__.
