Forms
=====

There is a way to update users metadata using the TYPO3 form framework. A registration and *password forgotten* form is also
available. If you are interested in that, do not hesitate to `contact <https://www.bitmotion.de/en/contact/>`__ us.

.. _about-contributing-Typo3AsIdentityProvider:

TYPO3 as Identity Provider
==========================

It is possible to use your existing TYPO3 instance as identity provider for Auth0. This is a comfortable way to integrate Auth0
into an existing environment where all user data and passwords are already stored in your TYPO3 instance. Other applications can
easily connect to your Auth0 tenant. You will not lose any existing user data or passwords.
