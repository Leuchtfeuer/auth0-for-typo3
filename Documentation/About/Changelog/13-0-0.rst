===========================
Version 13.0.0 - 2025/01/16
===========================

This release is a major release, which will likely be breaking.
It introduces TYPO3 13.4 support as well as support for PHP 8.2+ and drops support for TYPO3 <= 12 and PHP <= 8.1.
We first concentrated on the functionality of the backend login with the help of Auth0 and refactored and restructured
most of it. Support for frontend login was dropped, as it didn't worked with TYPO3 12.

Breaking
========

Support for frontend login was removed. If you rely on this feature, please don't hesitate to contact us for sponsoring!

Download
========

Added
=====

* Support for TYPO3 v13.4, PHP >= 8.2

Removed
=======

* Support for TYPO3 <= v12
* Code for frontend login (defunctional in TYPO3 v12)
