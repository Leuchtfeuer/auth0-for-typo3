==========================
Version 3.4.0 - 2020/12/29
==========================

This is a feature release. It contains some bug fixes, minor improvements regarding the backend module and backend login and
introduces the possibility to log in users without using the management API. This release also provides basic support for TYPO3
v11.0. Please note that general support for TYPO3 v11 LTS will be introduced with version 4.0 of this extension.

Download
========

Download this version from the `TYPO3 extension repository <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/auth0/>`__ or from
`GitHub <https://github.com/Leuchtfeuer/auth0-for-typo3/releases/tag/v3.4.0>`__.

Added
=====

* The login context (`FE` or `BE`) is now always set. Therefore the method :php:`withContext(string $context)` was added to the
  :php:`\Leuchtfeuer\Auth0\Utility\ApiUtility` class
* Basic support for TYPO3 v11.0. Please note that this extension is in beta state until TYPO3 v11 LTS is supported
* One Auth0 role can now be mapped to multiple TYPO3 user groups
* Make :ref:`key containing Auth0 user ID <admin-extensionConfiguration-properties-userIdentifier>` configurable (default value
  is: `sub`)
* The default template of the frontend login/logout button is now more accessible
* It is now possible to login users by ID token only (and
  :ref:`avoid using of management API <editor-dataTypes-application-properties-api>`)

Changed
=======

* Minor improvements within the backend module
* Applied updated Auth0 styleguide to backend login interface
* 3rd party libraries were updated
* TCA defaults for website and backend users will now be applied when user logs in for the first time

Deprecated
==========

* Using of :php:`EnvironmentService` class in :php:`AuthenticationService`. You can retrieve the proper context from
  :php:`$authenticationService->authInfo['loginType']`
* Specific API initialization via :php:`\Leuchtfeuer\Auth0\Api\Management`. You should use
  :php:`$management->getApi(\Your\Api\Class::class);` instead
* Specific API initialization via :php:`\Leuchtfeuer\Auth0\Utility\ApiUtility`. You should use
  :php:`$apiUtility->getApi(\Your\Api\Class::class, ...$scopes);` instead

Removed
=======

* Extbase persistence mapping for frontend users. You have to add the necessary files on your own if you want to override
  frontend users.
