==========================
Version 3.3.0 - 2020/06/15
==========================

This is a feature release. It contains a lot of bug fixes and necessary changes since website users without an usergroup will no
no longer be logged in. Unlike previously announced, the change of the configuration of TypoScript to a separate backend module
introduces further deprecations. Anyhow, these deprecations affect the TypoScript configuration only.

.. attention::

   You need to transform your TypoScript configuration for role and property mapping. Please see the
   :ref:`migration guide <migrations-backendModule>` for further information.

Download
========

Download this version from the `TYPO3 extension repository <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/auth0/>`__ or from
`GitHub <https://github.com/Leuchtfeuer/auth0-for-typo3/releases/tag/v3.3.0>`__.

Added
=====

* PSR-14 :ref:`event <developer-events>` :php:`Bitmotion\Auth0\Event\RedirectPreProcessingEvent` which will replace the now
  deprecated :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['t3lib/class.t3lib_userauth.php']['auth0']['redirect_pre_processing']`
  hook
* `Settings.yaml` file for listening to PSR-14 events in TYPO3 v10
* Event listener for adding parameters to :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['cacheHash']['excludedParameters']`
* Dedicated :ref:`backend module <admin-backendModule>` for handling data mapping and applications
* TypoScript constant for application storage page: :typoscript:`module.tx_auth0.persistence.storagePid`

Changed
=======

* Backend TypoScript is now separated from the frontend TypoScript settings. The :typoscript:`module.auth0` does not need to
  extend :typoscript:`plugin.tx_auth0`

Deprecated
==========

* Hook :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['t3lib/class.t3lib_userauth.php']['auth0']['redirect_pre_processing']` is
  now deprecated and will be removed with next major version. You should use the newly introduced PSR-14 Event where possible
* Using signal `afterExtensionInstall` of class :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Utility\InstallUtility`
* Following TypoScript settings are now deprecated: :typoscript:`plugin.tx_auth0.settings.roles`,
  :typoscript:`plugin.tx_auth0.settings.propertyMapping` and :typoscript:`plugin.tx_auth0.settings.backend`. You should use the
  newly introduced backend module instead
* Class :php:`ConfigurationUtility` is deprecated since TypoScript will only be used in controllers
* Several TypoScript related methods, constants and properties of class :php:`UpdateUtility`
