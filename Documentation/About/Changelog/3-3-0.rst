==========

* Hook :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['t3lib/class.t3lib_userauth.php']['auth0']['redirect_pre_processing']` is
  now deprecated and will be removed with next major version. You should use the newly introduced PSR-14 Event where possible
* Using signal `afterExtensionInstall` of class :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Utility\InstallUtility`
* Following TypoScript settings are now deprecated: :typoscript:`plugin.tx_auth0.settings.roles` and
  :typoscript:`plugin.tx_auth0.settings.propertyMapping`. You should use the newly introduced backend module instead.
