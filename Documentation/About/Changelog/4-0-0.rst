Version 4.0.0 - 2022/03/03
==========================

This release is a major release, which will likely be breaking.
Let's briefly explain why this has become a breaking release. Florian Wessels left Leuchtfeuer (thanks for the good work
again) and we had to deal with the extension completely from scratch. At the same time Auth0 released a new SDK which
also supports PHP 8. With a view to the future and TYPO3 v12 we wanted to be prepared accordingly.
We first concentrated on the functionality of the backend login with the help of Auth0 and refactored and restructured
most of it.
